**YouTubeDrive** is a Wolfram Language (aka *Mathematica*) package that encodes/decodes arbitrary data to/from simple RGB videos which are automatically uploaded to/downloaded from YouTube. Since YouTube imposes no limits on the total number or length of videos users can upload, this provides an effectively infinite but extremely slow form of file storage.

**YouTubeDrive** depends externally on [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [youtube-upload](https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload), and [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/). These programs must be downloaded and installed separately, and prior to first use, **YouTubeDrive** must be configured with their install locations. See below for details.

YouTubeDrive is a silly proof-of-concept, and I do not endorse its high-volume use.

## Usage Example

![Usage Example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4504054/27015901-fc81875c-4ede-11e7-9f99-3b7f7f4d4939.png)

**NOTE:** A short time needs to pass between calls to `YouTubeUpload` and `YouTubeRetrieve` for YouTube to process the uploaded video. I find that 5-10 minutes suffices for small (less than 10MB) file uploads.

The video **YouTubeDrive** produces in this example can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fmm1AeYmbNU.

## Installation

 * Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [youtube-upload](https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload), and [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) as your operating system dictates.
 * Find an arbitrary test video, say `test.mp4`, and run `youtube-upload --title="Test Video" test.mp4`. Follow the displayed instructions to create an OAuth token for your YouTube account. This will be the YouTube account used for all **YouTubeDrive** uploads.
 * Download and open `YouTubeDrive.wl` from this repository.
 * In lines 75-77, enter the install locations of the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [youtube-upload](https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload), and [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) executables. Make sure to use proper string escape sequences (in particular, backslashes `\` need to be escaped as double-backslashes `\\` in Windows paths).
    ```
    75 | FFmpegExecutablePath = "FFMPEG_PATH_HERE";
    76 | YouTubeUploadExecutablePath = "YOUTUBE-UPLOAD_PATH_HERE";
    77 | YouTubeDLExecutablePath = "YOUTUBE-DL_PATH_HERE";
    ```
   For example, I use the following install locations on my system (Windows 10):
    ```
    75 | FFmpegExecutablePath = "C:\\Games\\MiscExes\\ffmpeg.exe";
    76 | YouTubeUploadExecutablePath = Sequence["python",
    77 |   "C:\\Users\\dzhan\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\" <>
    78 |       "Python\\Python35\\Scripts\\youtube-upload.py"];
    79 | YouTubeDLExecutablePath = "C:\\Games\\MiscExes\\youtube-dl.exe";
    ```
   Note the use of `Sequence[]` to call `python youtube-upload.py` above.
 * After making the above edits, open `YouTubeDrive.wl` with *Mathematica*. Then, open the **File â‡¨ Install...** dialog, and select the following options:
    - Type of Item to Install: **Package**
    - Source: **YouTubeDrive.wl**
    - Install Name: **YouTubeDrive** (no `.wl` suffix)
   
   Choose installation for all users or the current user only, according to your preference, and click **OK**.
